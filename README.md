# PSL - PythonScryptLauncher

**WORK IN PROGRESS - My goal is to develope this project in parrel of my Python lessons**

My first personal project - A CLI Python Scrypt launcher for begginer Linux user

PSL is software, targeting Linux begginer user, allowing them to launch all their scrypts/applications without the need of using the terminal.

PSL display to the user the list of scrypts that he previously added, and allow him to launch them by simply selecting one of them. 

Typically, PLS would be launched at the startup of the OS. 

## Background

Switching to Linux (PopOs) from Windows, I discovered that I will have to now work with differents "kinds" of software. 
1. Some who are installed from package/Pop Store
2. Some .appimage 
3. Some who need to be started from the terminal (e.g PyCharm, ExpressVPN). 

Software from package or appimage are easy to handle. On the other hand, it's sometimes enoying to always have to use the terminal to launch a scrypt. So I decided to create this small application in order to facilitate my life.
