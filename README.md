# PSL - PythonScryptLauncher

**WORK IN PROGRESS - My goal is to develope this project in parrel of my Python lessons**

My first personal project - A CLI Python Scrypt launcher for begginer Linux user

PSL is software, targeting Linux begginer user, allowing them to launch all their scrypts/applications without the need of using the terminal.

PSL display to the user the list of scrypts that he added, and allow him to launch them by simply selecting the one that he would like to launch. 

Typically, PLS would be launched at the startup of the OS.
